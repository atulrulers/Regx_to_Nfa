# Regx_to_Nfa
A c++ program to convert regular expression into Non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) using Thompson's construction.
Further it is reduced to Detreminsitic finite automata (DFA) and there is a function which you can use to check various string belong to given regular expression or not.

Do make it better :) 

# PS :- Soon detail explanation of code will be uploaded.
